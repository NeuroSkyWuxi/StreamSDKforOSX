# StreamSDKforOSX
The Stream SDK for OSX provides a library for streaming and parsing EEG 
and ECG data from NeuroSky devices, such as MindWave Mobile. The data 
stream can be opened and read from Bluetooth, or from files (for 
previously-recorded data stream files).

If this is your first time using the “Stream SDK for OSX”, please start by 
reading the "StreamSDKForMac" PDF.  It will tell you everything you need to 
know to get started.

Happy coding!
